# 🎯 Guess The Number Game

A simple **C language console game** where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a given range and limited number of trials.

---

## 🧩 Introduction

Welcome to **Guess The Number Game** — a beginner-friendly C program that tests your logical thinking and number intuition!  
The program generates a random number within a user-specified range, and the player must guess it correctly within **3 attempts**.

This project demonstrates the use of:
- Loops (`while`, `for`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- Random number generation (`rand()` and `srand()`)
- User input handling with `scanf()`
- Modular programming using a custom function `instructions()`

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎲 Random number generation for each round  
- 🧠 Three trials per round  
- ⚠️ Validation for invalid and out-of-range inputs  
- 🔁 Option to replay until the user enters `0`  
- 🕹️ Simple and user-friendly interface  
- 🧾 Detailed instructions printed before the game starts
